Vertices G and H can be assigned a previously used color, red. Vertices C, I and J are adjacent to vertices of colors, both red and blue, hence, they need to be assigned a new color, green. And finally, since the vertex D is adjacent to vertices of colors, blue and green, we assign it the color red. Therefore, the chromatic number is 3 and the resultant graph is,\n",
