Such problems appear in the navigation system in cars, creating timetables for high schools, decision support systems in production and logistic environments, determining the optimal way to deliver packages etc. In many such problems, note that exhaustive search is not tractable for real-world problems. Now we'll proceed with some examples of combinatorial optimization problems. "
